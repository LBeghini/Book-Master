## How to run

To run this project, it's required that you install the following programs:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Editor or IDE ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) recommended)

After that, you'll need to clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/LBeghini/Book-Master.git
```

Or download the source code from a [release](https://github.com/LBeghini/Book-Master/releases), for a specific version of the app.

### Developers

In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm start
```

That will run the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  

### Testers

In the project directory, run:
```
npm run build
```
That will create a `build` folder.
  
After that, run:
```
serve -s build
```
And the app will be available for you to see, in two addresses: in `localhost` and your Local Network, both in `5000` port.  
The port can be adjusted using:  
```
serve -s build -l 4000
```
